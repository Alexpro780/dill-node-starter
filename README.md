# dill-node-starter
Starter tools for interacting with DILL validator nodes on the Alps Testnet.

help maintain distributed storage and routing;
strengthen decentralization and reliability as more nodes come online;
form the backbone for future Dill services like bridges, off-chain compute, and modular execution layers
